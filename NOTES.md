# Notepad for random odds and sods

## Inspiration

- The go repo wiki page on [Rate Limiting](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/RateLimiting)
- Blog posts:
  - [An alternative approach to rate limiting](
    https://medium.com/figma-design/an-alternative-approach-to-rate-limiting-f8a06cf7c94c)
    - I like this article a lot, because it dives into the theory and technical design and at the same time does not
    give away any implementation details, which strikes a good balance for my purposes
